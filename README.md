# Dockerized Indexhibit

A simple Dockerized version of Indexhibit, created for educational purposes.

**Do not use this for production.** This Docker setup is created primarily for
educational purposes, for those curious to explore the history of Web CMS's.
These settings are the bare minimum to get Indexhibit running in a Docker
environment and have been created for zero disregard for the application's
security. You have been warned!

## Why Indexhibit?

Indexhibit is a content management system from the early 2000s that provided a
foundation for many artists' websites in the 2000s. It is remembered (and
imitated) for sporting a "index+exhibit" -style layout that was very popular
during its heyday in the mid-to-late 2000s, where Tumblr and Pinterest-esque
"masonry" grids were paired with a minimalist sidebar navigation to create an
uncluttered browsing experience that illuminated the artists' contentâ€”much in
the way that a well-placed accent light foregrounds a work in a physical
exhibition space. It provided a format for artists to exhibit archives of their
work on the Web, and probably had an large influence on modern content
management/Web design.
